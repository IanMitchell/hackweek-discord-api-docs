### Membership Screening Object

In guilds with [Membership Screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins, [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway#guild-member-add) will be emitted but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [member object](#guild-member-object). When the member completes the screening, [Guild Member Update](/topics/gateway#guild-member-update) will be emitted and `pending` will be false.

Giving the member a role will bypass Membership Screening as well as the guild's verification level, giving the member immediate access to chat. Therefore, instead of giving a role when the member joins, it is recommended to not give the role until the user is no longer `pending`.

<Alert type="warn">

We are making significant changes to the Membership Screening API specifically related to getting and editing the Membership Screening object. Long story short is that it can be improved. As such, we have removed those documentation. There will **not be** any changes to how pending members work, as outlined above. That behavior will stay the same.

## Endpoints

<Alert type="warn">

For guilds with Membership Screening enabled, assigning a role using the `roles` parameter will add the user to the guild as a full member (`pending` is false in the [member object](#guild-member-object)). A member with a role will bypass membership screening and the guild's verification level, and get immediate access to chat. Therefore, instead of assigning a role when the member joins, it is recommended to grant roles only after the user completes screening.

<Alert type="info">

All parameters to this endpoint are optional and nullable. When moving members to channels, the API user _must_ have permissions to both connect to the channel and have the `MOVE_MEMBERS` permission.

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
- current user must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission to unsuppress yourself. You can always suppress yourself.
- You must have the `REQUEST_TO_SPEAK` permission to request to speak. You can always clear your own request to speak.
- You are able to set `request_to_speak_timestamp` to any present or future time.

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
- User must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission. (Since suppression is the only thing that is available currently.)
- When unsuppressed, non-bot users will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` set to the current time. Bot users will not.
- When suppressed, the user will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` removed.
