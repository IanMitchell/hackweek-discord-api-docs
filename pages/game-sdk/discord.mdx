Making a game? Need a whole bunch of fancy APIs to help make it great and your players' lives a breeze? Look no further! The Discord GameSDK is an easy drop-in SDK to help you manage all the hard things that come with making a game. Well, all the hards things about coding it at least. Interpersonal communication skills are on you (have you heard of this cool chat app called Discord?).

OK, cool, so how's it work?

## General Structure

At a high level, the Discord GameSDK has a class, `Discord`. This class is in charge of the creation of a few "manager" sub-classes. They are:

- `AchievementManager` - for achievements!
- `ActivityManager` - for Rich Presence and game invites
- `ApplicationManager` - for retrieving a user's OAuth2 bearer token, locale, and current game branch
- `ImageManager` - for getting data about images on Discord, like user avatars or chat images
- `LobbyManager` - for multiplayer lobbies
- `NetworkManager` - for all your networking layer needs
- `OverlayManager` - for interacting with Discord's built-in overlay
- `RelationshipManager` - for users' social relationships across Discord, including friends list
- `StorageManager` - for saving game data to the disk and the cloud
- `StoreManager` - for all things entitlements and SKUs, including IAP functionality
- `UserManager` - for fetching user data for a given id and the current user
- `VoiceManager` - to make use of Discord's awesome voice chat

Each one of these managers contain a number of methods and events used to interact with Discord in the context of the manager. For example, `RelationshipManager` has a function called `Filter()`, which lets you pare down a user's inter-Discord relationships based on a boolean condition, like being friends!

## Functions in the SDK

Most functions in the Discord GameSDK, uh, _function_ in a similar way. They take whatever parameters are required for the function to do its job—a user id, the requested size for an image, etc.—and a callback by means of a function pointer. That callback is fired when the function completes its work, letting you handle events without worrying about piping asynchronously-returned data to the right context.

Some functions behave with a normal return behavior; e.g. `RelationshipManager.Count()` just returns the number directly. Don't worry, it's outlined in the docs.

A quick example with our C# binding:

```c#
var userManager = discord.GetUserManager();

// Return via callback
userManager.GetUser(290926444748734465, (Discord.Result result, ref Discord.User otherUser) =>
{
  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Username);
    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Id);
  }
});


// Return normally
userManager.OnCurrentUserUpdate += () =>
{
    var currentUser = userManager.GetCurrentUser();
        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Username);
        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Discriminator);
        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Id);
    };
});
```

## Environment Variables

Discord passes a number of environment variables down to the SDK. These are accessed by various methods in the SDK and can be changed for local testing by changing the value in your local environment.

###### SDK Environment Variables

| name                   | method                                                                           | description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID    | [Local Testing](/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide#testing-locally-with-two-clients)    | the locally running instance of Discord to connect to; allows you to choose between multiple running clients |
| DISCORD_ACCESS_TOKEN   | [ApplicationManager.GetOAuth2Token()](/game-sdk/applications#getoauth2token)     | the connected user's bearer token                                                                            |
| DISCORD_CURRENT_LOCALE | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentLocale](/game-sdk/applications#getcurrentlocale)   | the language that Discord is in for the connected user                                                       |
| DISCORD_CURRENT_BRANCH | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentBranch()](/game-sdk/applications#getcurrentbranch) | the branch of the running application that the user has launched                                             |
| DISCORD_STORAGE_PATH   | [StorageManager.GetPath()](/game-sdk/storage#getpath)                            | the path to which Discord will save files if you're using the StorageManager                                 |

## Error Handling

Debugging is a pain, so before we get into the meat of the SDK, we want to make sure you're prepared for when things go awry. Within the Discord core is a function called `SetLogHook()`. It takes a `level`, which is minimum level of log message you want to listen to, and a callback function:

```cs
public void LogProblemsFunction(Discord.LogLevel level, string message)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Discord:{0} - {1}", level, message);
}

discord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemsFunction);
```

You should begin your integration by setting up this callback to help you debug. Helpfully, if you put a breakpoint inside the callback function you register here, you'll be able to see the stack trace for errors you run into (as long as they fail synchronously). Take the guess work out of debugging, or hey, ignore any and all logging by setting a callback that does nothing. We're not here to judge.

###### LogLevel Enum

| value   | description                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Error   | Log only errors                |
| Warning | Log warnings and errors        |
| Info    | Log info, warnings, and errors |
| Debug   | Log _all_ the things!          |

###### CreateFlags Enum

| value            | description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default          | Requires Discord to be running to play the game                     |
| NoRequireDiscord | Does not require Discord to be running, use this on other platforms |

## Create

Creates an instance of Discord to initialize the SDK. This is the overlord of all things Discord. We like to call her Nelly.

Returns a new `Discord`.

###### Parameters

| name     | type        | description                                         |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| clientId | Int64       | your application's client id                        |
| flags    | CreateFlags | the creation parameters for the SDK, outlined above |

###### Example

```
// c++ land
discord::Core* core{};
discord::Core::Create(53908232506183680, DiscordCreateFlags_Default, &core);

// c# land
var discord = new Discord(53908232506183680, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);
```

## Destroy

Destroys the instance. Wave goodbye, Nelly! You monster. In C# land, this is `Dispose()`.

<Alert type="info">

The C++ binding does not include a `destroy()` method, as the destructor for the Core does the work for you.

</Alert>

Returns `void`.

###### Parameters

None

###### Example

```cs
discord.Dispose();
```

## SetLogHook

Registers a logging callback function with the minimum level of message to receive. The callback function should have a signature of:

```
MyCallbackFunction(LogLevel level, string message);
```

Returns `void`.

###### Parameters

| name     | type     | description                                 |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| level    | LogLevel | the minimum level of event to log           |
| callback | function | the callback function to catch the messages |

###### Example

```cs
public void LogProblemsFunction(Discord.LogLevel level, string message)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Discord:{0} - {1}", level, message);
}

discord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemFunctions);
```

## RunCallbacks

Runs all pending SDK callbacks. Put this in your game's main event loop, like `Update()` in Unity. That way, the first thing your game does is check for any new info from Discord.

This function also serves as a way to know that the local Discord client is still connected. If the user closes Discord while playing your game, `RunCallbacks()` will return/throw `Discord.Result.NotRunning`.

In C and C++, this function returns `Discord.Result`. In C#, it returns `void` and will throw `Discord.Result` error if something went wrong.

###### Parameters

None

###### Example

```cs
void Update()
{
  discord.RunCallbacks();
}
```

## GetActivityManager
