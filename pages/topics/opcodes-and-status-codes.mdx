# Opcodes and Status Codes

## Gateway

All gateway events in Discord are tagged with an opcode that denotes the payload type. Your connection to our gateway may also sometimes close. When it does, you will receive a close code that tells you what happened.

###### Gateway Opcodes

## HTTP

Our API will return semantically valid HTTP response codes based on the success of your request. The following table can be used as a reference for response codes it will return.

###### HTTP Response Codes

| Code                      | Meaning                                                                          |

| 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)        | The `Authorization` header was missing or invalid.                               |
| 403 (FORBIDDEN)           | The `Authorization` token you passed did not have permission to the resource.    |
| 404 (NOT FOUND)           | The resource at the location specified doesn't exist.                            |

| 502 (GATEWAY UNAVAILABLE) | There was not a gateway available to process your request. Wait a bit and retry. |
| 5xx (SERVER ERROR)        | The server had an error processing your request (these are rare).                |

## JSON

Along with the HTTP error code, our API can also return more detailed error codes through a `code` key in the JSON error response. The response will also contain a `message` key containing a more friendly error string.

###### JSON Error Codes

| Code   | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
