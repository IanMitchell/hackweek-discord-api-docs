# Gateways

Gateways are Discord's form of real-time communication over secure WebSockets. Clients will receive events and data over the gateway they are connected to and send data over the REST API. The API for interacting with Gateways is complex and fairly unforgiving, therefore it's highly recommended you read _all_ of the following documentation before writing a custom implementation.

The Discord Gateway has a versioning system separate from the HTTP APIs. The documentation herein is only for the latest version in the following table, unless otherwise specified.

Important note: Not all event fields are documented, in particular, fields prefixed with an underscore are considered _internal fields_ and should not be relied on. We may change the format at any time.

###### Gateway Versions

| Version | Status                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| 9       | Available                        |
| 8       | Available                        |
| 7       | Doesn't look like anything to me |
| 6       | Deprecated                       |
| 5       | Discontinued                     |
| 4       | Discontinued                     |

## Payloads

###### Gateway Payload Structure

| Field | Type                    | Description                                                                |
| ----- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| op    | integer                 | [opcode](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#gateway-opcodes) for the payload |
| d     | ?mixed (any JSON value) | event data                                                                 |
| s     | ?integer \*             | sequence number, used for resuming sessions and heartbeats                 |
| t     | ?string \*              | the event name for this payload                                            |

\* `s` and `t` are `null` when `op` is not `0` (Gateway Dispatch Opcode).

### Sending Payloads

Packets sent from the client to the Gateway API are encapsulated within a [gateway payload object](#example-gateway-dispatch) and must have the proper opcode and data object set. The payload object can then be serialized in the format of choice (see [ETF/JSON](#etf/json)), and sent over the websocket. Payloads to the gateway are limited to a maximum of 4096 bytes sent, going over this will cause a connection termination with error code 4002.

###### Example Gateway Dispatch

```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "d": {},
  "s": 42,
  "t": "GATEWAY_EVENT_NAME"
}
```

### Receiving Payloads

Receiving payloads with the Gateway API is slightly more complex than sending. When using the JSON encoding with [Payload Compression](#payload-compression) enabled, the Gateway has the option of sending payloads as compressed JSON binaries using zlib, meaning your library _must_ detect (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)) and decompress these payloads before attempting to parse them. Otherwise the gateway does implement a shared compression context between messages sent, see [Transport Compression](#transport-compression).

## Encoding and Compression

#### ETF/JSON

When initially creating and handshaking connections to the Gateway, a user can choose whether they wish to communicate over plain-text JSON or binary [ETF](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html).

##### Using ETF

While using ETF there are some additional constraints to note:

- Snowflake IDs are transmitted as 64-bit integers over ETF.
- The client must not send compressed messages to the server.
- Payloads must use string keys, atom keys will lead to a 4002 decode error.

See [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for an ETF implementation example.

#### Payload Compression

When using JSON encoding with payload compression enabled (`compress: true` in identify), the Gateway may optionally send zlib-compressed payloads (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)). Your library _must_ detect and decompress these payloads to plain-text JSON before attempting to parse them. If you are using payload compression, the gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent. Payload compression will be disabled if you use transport compression (see below).

#### Transport Compression

Currently the only available transport compression option is `zlib-stream`. You will need to run all received packets through a shared zlib context, as seen in the example below. Every connection to the gateway should use its own unique zlib context.

###### Transport Compression Example

```python
# Z_SYNC_FLUSH suffix
ZLIB_SUFFIX = b'\x00\x00\xff\xff'
# initialize a buffer to store chunks
buffer = bytearray()
# create a zlib inflation context to run chunks through
inflator = zlib.decompressobj()

# ...
def on_websocket_message(msg):
  # always push the message data to your cache
  buffer.extend(msg)

  # check if the last four bytes are equal to ZLIB_SUFFIX
  if len(msg) < 4 or msg[-4:] != ZLIB_SUFFIX:
    return

  # if the message *does* end with ZLIB_SUFFIX,
  # get the full message by decompressing the buffers
  # NOTE: the message is utf-8 encoded.
  msg = inflator.decompress(buffer)
  buffer = bytearray()

  # here you can treat `msg` as either JSON or ETF encoded,
  # depending on your `encoding` param
```

## Connecting to the Gateway

### Connecting

###### Gateway URL Query String Params

| Field     | Type    | Description                                   | Accepted Values                           |
| --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| v         | integer | Gateway Version to use                        | see [Gateway versions](#gateway-versions) |
| encoding  | string  | The encoding of received gateway packets      | 'json' or 'etf'                           |
| compress? | string  | The (optional) compression of gateway packets | 'zlib-stream'                             |

The first step in establishing connectivity to the gateway is requesting a valid websocket endpoint from the API. This can be done through either the [Get Gateway](#get-gateway) or the [Get Gateway Bot](#get-gateway-bot) endpoint.

With the resulting payload, you can now open a websocket connection to the "url" (or endpoint) specified. Generally, it is a good idea to explicitly pass the gateway version and encoding. For example, we may connect to `wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=9&encoding=json`.

Once connected, the client should immediately receive an [Opcode 10 Hello](#hello) payload, with information on the connection's heartbeat interval:

###### Example Gateway Hello

```json
{
  "op": 10,
  "d": {
    "heartbeat_interval": 45000
  }
}
```

### Heartbeating

After receiving [Opcode 10 Hello](#hello), the client may begin sending [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#heartbeat) payloads after `heartbeat_interval * random.random()` milliseconds, and every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds thereafter. You may send heartbeats before this interval elapses, but you should avoid doing so unless necessary. There is already tolerance in the `heartbeat_interval` that will cover network latency, so you do not need to account for it in your own implementation - waiting the precise interval will suffice.

The gateway may request a heartbeat from the client in some situations by sending an [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#heartbeat). When this occurs, the client should immediately send an [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#heartbeat) without waiting the remainder of the current interval.

Any time the client sends a heartbeat, the gateway will respond with [Opcode 11 Heartbeat ACK](#example-gateway-heartbeat-ack), a successful _acknowledgement_ of their last heartbeat:

###### Example Gateway Heartbeat ACK

```json
{
  "op": 11
}
```

If a client does not receive a heartbeat ack between its attempts at sending heartbeats, this may be due to a failed or "zombied" connection. The client should then immediately terminate the connection with a non-1000 close code, reconnect, and attempt to [Resume](#resuming).

<Alert type="info">

In the event of a service outage where you stay connected to the gateway, you should continue to heartbeat and receive ACKs. The gateway will eventually respond and issue a session once it's able to.

</Alert>

### Identifying

Next, the client is expected to send an [Opcode 2 Identify](#identify):

###### Example Gateway Identify

This is a minimal `IDENTIFY` payload. `IDENTIFY` supports additional optional fields for other session properties, such as payload compression, or an initial presence state. See the [Identify Structure](#identify) for a more complete example of all options you can pass in.

```json
{
  "op": 2,
  "d": {
    "token": "my_token",
    "intents": 513,
    "properties": {
      "$os": "linux",
      "$browser": "my_library",
      "$device": "my_library"
    }
  }
}
```

If the payload is valid, the gateway will respond with a [Ready](#ready) event. Your client is now considered in a "connected" state. Clients are limited by [maximum concurrency](#session-start-limit-object) when [Identifying](#identify); if they exceed this limit, the gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#invalid-session). It is important to note that although the ready event contains a large portion of the required initial state, some information (such as guilds and their members) is sent asynchronously (see [Guild Create](#guild-create) event).

<Alert type="warn">

Clients are limited to 1000 `IDENTIFY` calls to the websocket in a 24-hour period. This limit is global and across all shards, but does not include `RESUME` calls. Upon hitting this limit, all active sessions for the bot will be terminated, the bot's token will be reset, and the owner will receive an email notification. It's up to the owner to update their application with the new token.

</Alert>

## Resuming

The Internet is a scary place. Disconnections happen, especially with persistent connections. Due to Discord's architecture, this is a semi-regular event and should be expected and handled. Discord has a process for "resuming" (or reconnecting) a connection that allows the client to replay any lost events from the last sequence number they received in the exact same way they would receive them normally.

Your client should store the `session_id` from the [Ready](#ready), and the sequence number of the last event it received. When your client detects that it has been disconnected, it should completely close the connection and open a new one (following the same strategy as [Connecting](#connecting)). Once the new connection has been opened, the client should send a [Gateway Resume](#resume):

###### Example Gateway Resume

```json
{
  "op": 6,
  "d": {
    "token": "my_token",
    "session_id": "session_id_i_stored",
    "seq": 1337
  }
}
```

If successful, the gateway will respond by replaying all missed events in order, finishing with a [Resumed](#resumed) event to signal replay has finished, and all subsequent events are new. It's also possible that your client cannot reconnect in time to resume, in which case the client will receive a [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#invalid-session) and is expected to wait a random amount of time—between 1 and 5 seconds—then send a fresh [Opcode 2 Identify](#identify).

### Disconnections

If the gateway ever issues a disconnect to your client, it will provide a close event code that you can use to properly handle the disconnection. A full list of these close codes can be found in the [Response Codes](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#gateway-close-event-codes) documentation.

When you close the connection to the gateway with the close code 1000 or 1001, your session will be invalidated and your bot will appear offline. If you simply close the TCP connection, or use a different close code, the bot session will remain active and timeout after a few minutes. This can be useful for a reconnect, which will resume the previous session.

## Gateway Intents

<Alert type="info">

Intents are optionally supported on the v6 gateway but required as of v8

</Alert>

Maintaining a stateful application can be difficult when it comes to the amount of data you're expected to process, especially at scale. Gateway Intents are a system to help you lower that computational burden.

When [identifying](#identifying) to the gateway, you can specify an `intents` parameter which allows you to conditionally subscribe to pre-defined "intents", groups of events defined by Discord. If you do not specify a certain intent, you will not receive any of the gateway events that are batched into that group. The valid intents are:

\* [Thread Members Update](#thread-members-update) contains different data depending on which intents are used.

### Caveats

Any [events not defined in an intent](#gateway-events) are considered "passthrough" and will always be sent to you.

[Guild Member Update](#guild-member-update) is sent for current-user updates regardless of whether the `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent is set.

[Guild Create](#guild-create) and [Request Guild Members](#request-guild-members) are uniquely affected by intents. See these sections for more information.

[Thread Members Update](#thread-members-update) by default only includes if the current user was added to or removed from a thread. To receive these updates for other users, request the `GUILD_MEMBERS` [Gateway Intent](#gateway-intents).

If you specify an `intent` value in your `IDENTIFY` payload that is _invalid_, the socket will close with a [`4013` close code](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#gateway-close-event-codes). An invalid intent is one that is not meaningful and not documented above.

If you specify an `intent` value in your `IDENTIFY` payload that is _disallowed_, the socket will close with a [`4014` close code](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#gateway-close-event-codes). A disallowed intent is a privileged intent that has not been approved for your bot.

Bots in under 100 guilds can enable these intents in the bot tab of the developer dashboard. Verified bots can get access to privileged intents when getting verified, or by writing into support after getting verified.

### Privileged Intents

<Alert type="warn">

Message content will become a privileged intent in 2022. [Learn more here](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055).

</Alert>

Some intents are defined as "Privileged" due to the sensitive nature of the data. Those intents are:

- `GUILD_PRESENCES`
- `GUILD_MEMBERS`

To specify these intents in your `IDENTIFY` payload, you must visit your application page in the Developer Portal and enable the toggle for each Privileged Intent that you wish to use. If your bot qualifies for [verification](https://dis.gd/bot-verification), you must first [verify your bot](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412-Bot-Verification-and-Data-Whitelisting) and request access to these intents during the verification process. If your bot is already verified and you need to request additional privileged intents, [contact support](https://dis.gd/support).

Events under the `GUILD_PRESENCES` and `GUILD_MEMBERS` intents are turned **off by default on all gateway versions**. If you are using **Gateway v6**, you will receive those events if you are authorized to receive them and have enabled the intents in the Developer Portal. You do not need to use Intents on Gateway v6 to receive these events; you just need to enable the flags.

If you are using **Gateway v8** or above, Intents are mandatory and must be specified when identifying.

In addition to the gateway restrictions described here, Discord's REST API is also affected by Privileged Intents. Specifically, to use the [List Guild Members](/resources/guild#list-guild-members) endpoint, you must have the `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent enabled for your application. This behavior is independent of whether the intent is set during `IDENTIFY`.

## Rate Limiting

<Alert type="info">

This section is about Gateway rate limits, not [HTTP API rate limits](/topics/rate-limits/)

</Alert>

Clients are allowed to send 120 [gateway commands](#commands-and-events) every 60 seconds, meaning you can send an average of 2 commands per second. Clients who surpass this limit are immediately disconnected from the Gateway, and similarly to the HTTP API, repeat offenders will have their API access revoked. Clients also have a limit of [concurrent](#session-start-limit-object) [Identify](#identify) requests allowed per 5 seconds. If you hit this limit, the Gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#invalid-session).

## Tracking State

Most of a client's state is provided during the initial [Ready](#ready) event and the [Guild Create](#guild-create) events that immediately follow. As objects are further created/updated/deleted, other events are sent to notify the client of these changes and to provide the new or updated data. To avoid excessive API calls, Discord expects clients to locally cache as many _relevant_ object states as possible, and to update them as gateway events are received.

An example of state tracking can be found with member status caching. When initially connecting to the gateway, the client receives information regarding the online status of guild members (online, idle, dnd, offline). To keep this state updated, a client must track and parse [Presence Update](#presence-update) events as they are received, and apply the provided data to the cached member objects.

For larger bots, client state can grow to be quite large. We recommend only storing objects in memory that are needed for a bot's operation. Many bots, for example, just respond to user input through chat commands. These bots may only need to keep guild information (like guild/channel roles and permissions) in memory, since [MESSAGE_CREATE](#message-create) and [MESSAGE_UPDATE](#message-update) events have the full member object available.

## Guild Availability

When connecting to the gateway as a bot user, guilds that the bot is a part of will start out as unavailable. Don't fret! The gateway will automatically attempt to reconnect on your behalf. As guilds become available to you, you will receive [Guild Create](#guild-create) events.

## Sharding

As bots grow and are added to an increasing number of guilds, some developers may find it necessary to break or split portions of their bots operations into separate logical processes. As such, Discord gateways implement a method of user-controlled guild sharding which allows for splitting events across a number of gateway connections. Guild sharding is entirely user controlled, and requires no state-sharing between separate connections to operate.

To enable sharding on a connection, the user should send the `shard` array in the [Identify](#identify) payload. The first item in this array should be the zero-based integer value of the current shard, while the second represents the total number of shards. DMs will only be sent to shard 0. To calculate what events will be sent to what shard, the following formula can be used:

###### Sharding Formula

```python
shard_id = (guild_id >> 22) % num_shards
```

As an example, if you wanted to split the connection between three shards, you'd use the following values for `shard` for each connection: `[0, 3]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[2, 3]`. Note that only the first shard (`[0, 3]`) would receive DMs.

Note that `num_shards` does not relate to, or limit, the total number of potential sessions—it is only used for _routing_ traffic. As such, sessions do not have to be identified in an evenly distributed manner when sharding. You can establish multiple sessions with the same `[shard_id, num_shards]`, or sessions with different `num_shards` values. This allows you to create sessions that will handle more or less traffic than others for more fine-tuned load balancing, or orchestrate "zero-downtime" scaling/updating by handing off traffic to a new deployment of sessions with a higher or lower `num_shards` count that are prepared in parallel.

###### Max Concurrency

If you have multiple shards, you may start them concurrently based on the [`max_concurrency`](#session-start-limit-object) value returned to you on session start. Which shards you can start concurrently are assigned based on a key for each shard. The rate limit key for a given shard can be computed with

```
rate_limit_key = shard_id % max_concurrency
```

This puts your shards into "buckets" of `max_concurrency` size. When you start your bot, you may start up to `max_concurrency` shards at a time, and you must start them by "bucket" **in order**. To explain another way, let's say you have 16 shards, and your `max_concurrency` is 16:

```
shard_id: 0, rate limit key (0 % 16): 0
shard_id: 1, rate limit key (1 % 16): 1
shard_id: 2, rate limit key (2 % 16): 2
shard_id: 3, rate limit key (3 % 16): 3
shard_id: 4, rate limit key (4 % 16): 4
shard_id: 5, rate limit key (5 % 16): 5
shard_id: 6, rate limit key (6 % 16): 6
shard_id: 7, rate limit key (7 % 16): 7
shard_id: 8, rate limit key (8 % 16): 8
shard_id: 9, rate limit key (9 % 16): 9
shard_id: 10, rate limit key (10 % 16): 10
shard_id: 11, rate limit key (11 % 16): 11
shard_id: 12, rate limit key (12 % 16): 12
shard_id: 13, rate limit key (13 % 16): 13
shard_id: 14, rate limit key (14 % 16): 14
shard_id: 15, rate limit key (15 % 16): 15
```

You may start all 16 of your shards at once, because each has a `rate_limit_key` which fills the bucket of 16 shards. However, let's say you had 32 shards:

```
shard_id: 0, rate limit key (0 % 16): 0
shard_id: 1, rate limit key (1 % 16): 1
shard_id: 2, rate limit key (2 % 16): 2
shard_id: 3, rate limit key (3 % 16): 3
shard_id: 4, rate limit key (4 % 16): 4
shard_id: 5, rate limit key (5 % 16): 5
shard_id: 6, rate limit key (6 % 16): 6
shard_id: 7, rate limit key (7 % 16): 7
shard_id: 8, rate limit key (8 % 16): 8
shard_id: 9, rate limit key (9 % 16): 9
shard_id: 10, rate limit key (10 % 16): 10
shard_id: 11, rate limit key (11 % 16): 11
shard_id: 12, rate limit key (12 % 16): 12
shard_id: 13, rate limit key (13 % 16): 13
shard_id: 14, rate limit key (14 % 16): 14
shard_id: 15, rate limit key (15 % 16): 15
shard_id: 16, rate limit key (16 % 16): 0
shard_id: 17, rate limit key (17 % 16): 1
shard_id: 18, rate limit key (18 % 16): 2
shard_id: 19, rate limit key (19 % 16): 3
shard_id: 20, rate limit key (20 % 16): 4
shard_id: 21, rate limit key (21 % 16): 5
shard_id: 22, rate limit key (22 % 16): 6
shard_id: 23, rate limit key (23 % 16): 7
shard_id: 24, rate limit key (24 % 16): 8
shard_id: 25, rate limit key (25 % 16): 9
shard_id: 26, rate limit key (26 % 16): 10
shard_id: 27, rate limit key (27 % 16): 11
shard_id: 28, rate limit key (28 % 16): 12
shard_id: 29, rate limit key (29 % 16): 13
shard_id: 30, rate limit key (30 % 16): 14
shard_id: 31, rate limit key (31 % 16): 15
```

In this case, you must start the shard buckets **in "order"**. That means that you can start shard 0 -> shard 15 concurrently, and then you can start shard 16 -> shard 31.

## Sharding for Very Large Bots

If you own a bot that is near or in over 150,000 guilds, there are some additional considerations you must take around sharding. Please file a support-ticket to get moved to the sharding for big bots, when you reach near this amount of servers. You can contact the discord support using [https://dis.gd/contact](https://dis.gd/contact).

The number of shards you run must be a multiple of a fixed number we will determine when reaching out to you. If you attempt to start your bot with an invalid number of shards, your websocket connection will close with a 4010 Invalid Shard opcode. The gateway bot bootstrap endpoint will return the correct amount of shards, so if you're already using this endpoint to determine your number of shards, you shouldn't require any further changes.

The session start limit for these bots will also be increased from 1000 to `max(2000, (guild_count / 1000) * 3)` per day. You also receive an increased `max_concurrency`, the number of [shards you can concurrently start](#session-start-limit-object).

Finally, the [Get Current User Guilds](/resources/user#get-current-user-guilds) endpoint will no longer return results for your bot. We will be creating a new endpoint that is more shard-aware to iterate through your bot's guilds if needed.

## Commands and Events

Commands are requests made to the gateway socket by a client.

### Event Names

Event names are in standard constant form, fully upper-cased and replacing all spaces with underscores. For instance, [Channel Create](#channel-create) would be `CHANNEL_CREATE` and [Voice State Update](#voice-state-update) would be `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE`. Within the following documentation, they have been left in standard English form to aid in readability.

  "d": {
    "token": "randomstring",
    "session_id": "evenmorerandomstring",
    "seq": 1337
  }
}
```

#### Heartbeat

Used to maintain an active gateway connection. Must be sent every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds after the [Opcode 10 Hello](#hello) payload is received. The inner `d` key is the last sequence number—`s`—received by the client. If you have not yet received one, send `null`.

###### Example Heartbeat

```
{
	"op": 1,
	"d": 251
}
```

#### Request Guild Members

Used to request all members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, if you don't have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway Intent](#gateway-intents), or if the guild is over 75k members, it will only send members who are in voice, plus the member for you (the connecting user). Otherwise, if a guild has over `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#identify)), it will only send members who are online, have a role, have a nickname, or are in a voice channel, and if it has under `large_threshold` members, it will send all members. If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. The server will send [Guild Members Chunk](#guild-members-chunk) events in response with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.

Due to our privacy and infrastructural concerns with this feature, there are some limitations that apply:

- `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent is required to set `presences = true`. Otherwise, it will always be false
- `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent is required to request the entire member list—`(query=‘’, limit=0<=n)`
- You will be limited to requesting 1 `guild_id` per request
- Requesting a prefix (`query` parameter) will return a maximum of 100 members
- Requesting `user_ids` will continue to be limited to returning 100 members

### Connecting and Resuming

#### Hello

Sent on connection to the websocket. Defines the heartbeat interval that the client should heartbeat to.

###### Example Hello

```json
{
  "op": 10,
  "d": {
    "heartbeat_interval": 45000
  }
}
```

#### Ready

The ready event is dispatched when a client has completed the initial handshake with the gateway (for new sessions). The ready event can be the largest and most complex event the gateway will send, as it contains all the state required for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.

`guilds` are the guilds of which your bot is a member. They start out as unavailable when you connect to the gateway. As they become available, your bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#guild-create) events.

###### Ready Event Fields

| Field       | Type                                                                            | Description                                                                               |

| session_id  | string                                                                          | used for resuming connections                                                             |
| shard?      | array of two integers (shard_id, num_shards)                                    | the [shard information](#sharding) associated with this session, if sent when identifying |
| application | partial [application object](/resources/application#application-object)         | contains `id` and `flags`                                                                 |

#### Resumed

The resumed event is dispatched when a client has sent a [resume payload](#resume) to the gateway (for resuming existing sessions).

#### Reconnect

The reconnect event is dispatched when a client should reconnect to the gateway (and resume their existing session, if they have one). This event usually occurs during deploys to migrate sessions gracefully off old hosts.

###### Example Gateway Reconnect

```json
{
  "op": 7,
  "d": null
}
```

#### Invalid Session

Sent to indicate one of at least three different situations:

- the gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#identify)
- the gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#resume)
- the gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action

The inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](#connecting) and [Resuming](#resuming) for more information.

###### Example Gateway Invalid Session

```json
{
  "op": 9,
  "d": false
}
```

### Channels

#### Channel Create

Sent when a new guild channel is created, relevant to the current user. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object.

#### Channel Update

Sent when a channel is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the last_message_id changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#message-create) events.

#### Channel Delete

Sent when a channel relevant to the current user is deleted. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object.

#### Thread Create

Sent when a thread is created, relevant to the current user, or when the current user is added to a thread. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object. When being added to an existing private thread, includes a [thread member](/resources/channel#thread-member-object) object.

#### Thread Update

Sent when a thread is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the last_message_id changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#message-create) events.

#### Thread Delete

Sent when a thread relevant to the current user is deleted. The inner payload is a subset of the [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) object, containing just the `id`, `guild_id`, `parent_id`, and `type` fields.

#### Thread List Sync

Sent when the current user _gains_ access to a channel.

If omitted, then threads were synced for the entire guild. This array may contain channel_ids that have no active threads as well, so you know to clear that data. |
| threads      | array of [channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) objects             | all active threads in the given channels that the current user can access                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Thread Member Update

Sent when the [thread member](/resources/channel#thread-member-object) object for the current user is updated. The inner payload is a [thread member](/resources/channel#thread-member-object) object. This event is documented for completeness, but unlikely to be used by most bots. For bots, this event largely is just a signal that you are a member of the thread. See the [threads docs](/topics/threads) for more details.

#### Thread Members Update

Sent when anyone is added to or removed from a thread. If the current user does not have the `GUILD_MEMBERS` [Gateway Intent](#gateway-intents), then this event will only be sent if the current user was added to or removed from the thread.

### Guilds

#### Guild Create

This event can be sent in three different scenarios:

1.  When a user is initially connecting, to lazily load and backfill information for all unavailable guilds sent in the [Ready](#ready) event. Guilds that are unavailable due to an outage will send a [Guild Delete](#guild-delete) event.
2.  When a Guild becomes available again to the client.
3.  When the current user joins a new Guild.

The inner payload is a [guild](/resources/guild#guild-object) object, with all the extra fields specified.

<Alert type="warn">

If your bot does not have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway Intent](#gateway-intents), or if the guild has over 75k members, members and presences returned in this event will only contain your bot and users in voice channels.

</Alert>

#### Guild Update

Sent when a guild is updated. The inner payload is a [guild](/resources/guild#guild-object) object.

#### Guild Delete

Sent when a guild becomes or was already unavailable due to an outage, or when the user leaves or is removed from a guild. The inner payload is an [unavailable guild](/resources/guild#unavailable-guild-object) object. If the `unavailable` field is not set, the user was removed from the guild.

#### Guild Ban Add

### Presence

#### Presence Update

<Alert type="warn">

If you are using [Gateway Intents](#gateway-intents), you _must_ specify the `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent in order to receive Presence Update events

</Alert>

A user's presence is their current state on a guild. This event is sent when a user's presence or info, such as name or avatar, is updated.

<Alert type="warn">

The user object within this event can be partial, the only field which must be sent is the `id` field, everything else is optional. Along with this limitation, no fields are required, and the types of the fields are **not** validated. Your client should expect any combination of fields and types within this event.

<RouteHeader
  method="GET"
  url="/gateway"
  requestDoesNotRequireAuthorizationHeader
>
  Get Gateway
</RouteHeader>

Returns an object with a single valid WSS URL, which the client can use for [Connecting](#connecting). Clients **should** cache this value and only call this endpoint to retrieve a new URL if they are unable to properly establish a connection using the cached version of the URL.

###### Example Response

```json
{
  "url": "wss://gateway.discord.gg/"
}
```

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/gateway/bot">
  Get Gateway Bot
</RouteHeader>

Returns an object based on the information in [Get Gateway](#get-gateway), plus additional metadata that can help during the operation of large or [sharded](#sharding) bots. Unlike the [Get Gateway](#get-gateway), this route should not be cached for extended periods of time as the value is not guaranteed to be the same per-call, and changes as the bot joins/leaves guilds.
