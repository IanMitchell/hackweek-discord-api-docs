# Store Channels

One of the new flagship features of Verified Servers and Game Servers are the ability to host your store pages directly in your server. We know that community is everything for games, and that your server is already the place where your community lives. Rather than the friction and impersonality of traditional storefronts, you can let your fans find your game in the cozy comfort of their home (your server!).

In order to create a store channel for your game, you'll need to make sure you've followed [the Walkthrough](/game-and-server-management/how-to-get-your-game-on-discord/) up to `Getting Approved`. If you've done that, you'll see in your server that you can create a new channel type: `Store`.

Along with entering a name for your new channel, you'll be prompted to select an application. This should be the app you created when you started; it's the one linked to your server. After selecting your app, you'll be prompted to select a SKU. What's a SKU? A SKU is simply a thing that a user can buy. This is most likely your game (a SKU of type `Game`), but could also be `IAP`, `DLC`, or a `Bundle`.

You can create SKUs to put up for sale by going to your app and selecting `SKU Management`.

Once you select your SKU and create your channel...it's there! You now have a store channel in your server! If you want, you can set permissions on this channel like any channel in a server to restrict who can see it. Learn more about that by reading [Alpha and Beta Testing](/game-and-server-management/alpha-and-beta-testing/).

## Lurker Mode

Store channels also have a special property that we call `lurkability`. "Lurker Mode" is a feature that we've been experimenting with throughout Discord; it allows users to read public channels in a server without _actually_ joining the server. It also allows users to look at these channels without being logged in to Discord.

<Alert type="info">

Users viewing channels in Lurker Mode will not be able to send messages in those channels. They'll be prompted to log in and join the server if they want to chat.

</Alert>

Lurker Mode is automatically enabled for store channels in your server. When someone accepts a server invite that links to a store channel, they'll be viewing in "Lurker Mode".

We know that your server and community are at the heart of your game's success on Discord. Having Discord users see your store pages in the context of your server will help drive more members to your community and help you grow that awesome fanbase for your game.

# Announcement Channels

As part of our ongoing effort to help you build your game community, all [Community servers](https://dis.gd/communityservers) (along with [Developer License](/game-and-server-management/how-to-get-your-game-on-discord#your-server---your-kingdom) servers) have the ability to create Announcement Channels!

Unlike a regular text channel, Announcement Channels comes with a “Follow” button that allows your superfans to hook and connect your channel into their own personal servers. Now, select messages in your Announcement Channels can be "published" in your players' friend servers as regular messages, allowing them to get the latest updates of their favorite game in the places they hang out most. Because these posts appear and function as messages, it means that everyone in your superfan’s server can find them, discuss them live, and receive them as mobile notifications, if they have this setting enabled.
